Moderate KNN, Fuzzy KNN and R radius neighbour KNN (Matlab)

In Moderate KNN: I used the "fitcknn" function of Matlab and "mse" in error calculation.

In Fuzzy KNN: I desinged an algorithm to make Fuzzy KNN with 5 fold cross validation. In order to explain each step of cross validation, I divided each iteration instead of coding in a cell array.

R radius neighbour KNN: I desinged an algorithm to make R radius neighbour KNN. For radius value, I found the optimal value by trying in code according to the minimum error value.
