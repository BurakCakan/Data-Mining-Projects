# Naive-Bayes-Classification 
Naive Bayes Classification Algorithm (Matlab)

This is used for categorical data which is named as UniversalBank.xls

I used Freedman-Diaconis Rule" in order to predict bin width as a rule of thumb. 

There is negative values that are anormal for the data. I thought that there should be a mistake during typing the value by writing minus accidentally. As a data scient, I changed the sign of these negative values. 

Finally, I compared the error value of my algorithm with the Naive Rule. Error rate of my algorithm is better than Naive Rule.
